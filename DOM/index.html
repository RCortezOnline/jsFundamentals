    <title>Intro to DOM Manipulation</title>
</head>
<body>

    
<!--We can write javascript directly in our html page by typing it within a <script> tag , similar to how we would write css in a <style> tag 
-->
<!-- DOM stands for Document Object Model, and is what allows our JS to interact with the HTML & CSS of our page. The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML p0age and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser's window 

DOM is an object representation of a web page, which can be modified with a scripting language like JS

Two primary functions:
1- M<aking a model of an HTML page
-when the browser loads a webpage, it creates a mofel of the page in memory
-the DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree. The DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree is made of objects.

2. Accessing and changin the HTML page
- The DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each opbject in the model, which turn updates what the user sees in the browser

Usually when working with the DOM tree, we will access an element we want to work with, and then we will modify, or manipulate it.

ACCESSING:
COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESSING SINGLE ELEMENTS:
-getElementById()
-querySelector()

COMMON METHODS FOR ACCESS MULTIPLE ELEMENTS:
-querySelectorAll()
-getElementByClassName()
-get ElementByTagName()

MANIPULATING:
COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH HTML CONTENT:
-innerHTML 
-textContent
-create Element

COMMON METHODS FOR WORKING WITH TAG ATTRIBUTES:
-className / id
- setAttribute()
- getAttribute()i

    // now we can write some JS 
    console.log('Hello from the script tag~!');
</script> -->

<!-- What if we want to use an external JS file in thiss webpage? -->
